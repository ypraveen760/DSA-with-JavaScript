If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).\n\nFor example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].\nSimilarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].\nWhile the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.\n\nGiven an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.\nThe replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3]\nOutput: [1,3,2]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [3,2,1]\nOutput: [1,2,3]\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,5]\nOutput: [1,5,1]\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n0 <= nums[i] <= 100\n\n",

This is 0 if there is no intersected node.\nlistA - The first linked list.\nlistB - The second linked list.\nskipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\nskipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n\nThe judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3\nOutput: Intersected at '8'\nExplanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.\n- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1\nOutput: Intersected at '2'\nExplanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4].

From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.\nExplanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes of listA is in the m.\nThe number of nodes of listB is in the n.\n1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104\n1 <= Node.val <= 105\n0 <= skipA <= m\n0 <= skipB <= n\nintersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.\nintersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.\n\n\u00a0\nFollow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(m + n) time and use only O(1) memory?",

Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n\nAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\nAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\nAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\nAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThe next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board. In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously.\nGiven the current state of the board, update the board to reflect its next state.\nNote that you do not need to return anything.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,1],[1,1]]\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nm == board.length\nn == board[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 25\nboard[i][j] is 0 or 1.\n\n\u00a0\nFollow up:\n\nCould you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.\nIn this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border).

Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.\n\nGiven the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.\nThe hint should be formatted as \"xAyB\", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows.

        "description": "A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.\n\nFor example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.\nIn contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.\n\nA subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.\nGiven an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.\nOne is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\nOutput: 2\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n0 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n\n\u00a0\nFollow up: Could you solve this in O(n) time?\n",

        "description": "Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree.\nReturn the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid.\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\nval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\nisLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.\n\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\nIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\nQuad-Tree format:\nYou don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:\nNotice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nExplanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.\nThe topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.\nThe topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.\nExplanation is shown in the photo below:\n\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == grid.length == grid[i].length\nn == 2x where 0 <= x <= 6\n\n",

        "description": "You are playing a variation of the game Zuma.\nIn this variation of Zuma, there is a single row of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red 'R', yellow 'Y', blue 'B', green 'G', or white 'W'. You also have several colored balls in your hand.\nYour goal is to clear all of the balls from the board. On each turn:\n\nPick any ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.\nIf there is a group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, remove the group of balls from the board.\n\t\nIf this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.\n\n\nIf there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.\nRepeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.\n\nGiven a string board, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string hand, representing the balls in your hand, return the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board. If you cannot clear all the balls from the board using the balls in your hand, return -1.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: board = \"WRRBBW\", hand = \"RB\"\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: It is impossible to clear all the balls. The best you can do is:\n- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WRRRBBW. WRRRBBW -> WBBW.\n- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WBBBW. WBBBW -> WW.\nThere are still balls remaining on the board, and you are out of balls to insert.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: board = \"WWRRBBWW\", hand = \"WRBRW\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: To make the board empty:\n- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WWRRRBBWW. WWRRRBBWW -> WWBBWW.\n- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WWBBBWW. WWBBBWW -> WWWW -> empty.\n2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: board = \"G\", hand = \"GGGGG\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: To make the board empty:\n- Insert 'G' so the board becomes GG.\n- Insert 'G' so the board becomes GGG. GGG -> empty.\n2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= board.length <= 16\n1 <= hand.length <= 5\nboard and hand consist of the characters 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', and 'W'.\nThe initial row of balls on the board will not have any groups of three or more consecutive balls of the same color.\n\n",

Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\nval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.\nisLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\nIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\nQuad-Tree format:\nThe input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n \n\nInput: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0]]\n, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nOutput: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree.\nIf we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree.\nNotice that the binary matrices shown are only for illustration, you don't have to construct the binary matrix to get the result tree.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: quadTree1 = [[1,0]], quadTree2 = [[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,0]]\nExplanation: Each tree represents a binary matrix of size 1*1. Each matrix contains only zero.\nThe resulting matrix is of size 1*1 with also zero.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nquadTree1 and quadTree2 are both valid Quad-Trees each representing a n * n grid.\nn == 2x where 0 <= x <= 9.\n\n",

Otherwise, the code is invalid.\nA closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\nA valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.\nA valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\nA < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\nThe cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.\nCDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: code = \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\nstart_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\nend_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\ntext1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\ncdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\ntext2 -> \"]]>>]\"\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: code = \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Unbalanced.

        "description": "Given the root node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n\nNode Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.\n\n\nParentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:\n\nIf a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.\nIf a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.\n\n\n\nOmitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.\nIn summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: \"1(2(4))(3)\"\nExplanation: Originally, it needs to be \"1(2(4)())(3()())\", but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be \"1(2(4))(3)\".\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,null,4]\nOutput: \"1(2()(4))(3)\"\nExplanation: Almost the same as the first example, except the () after 2 is necessary to indicate the absence of a left child for 2 and the presence of a right child.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n",

By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: tasks = [\"A\",\"C\",\"A\",\"B\",\"D\",\"B\"], n = 1\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.\nWith a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: tasks = [\"A\",\"A\",\"A\", \"B\",\"B\",\"B\"], n = 3\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.\nThere are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= tasks.length <= 104\ntasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.\n0 <= n <= 100\n\n",

The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called \"Ring Buffer\".\nOne of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.\nImplement the MyCircularQueue class:\n\nMyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.\nint Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\nint Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\nboolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.\nboolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.\nboolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.\nboolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.\n\nYou must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput\n[\"MyCircularQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"Rear\", \"isFull\", \"deQueue\", \"enQueue\", \"Rear\"]\n[[3], [1], [2], [3], [4], [], [], [], [4], []]\nOutput\n[null, true, true, true, false, 3, true, true, true, 4]\n\nExplanation\nMyCircularQueue myCircularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3);\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(1); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(2); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(3); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return False\nmyCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 3\nmyCircularQueue.isFull();   // return True\nmyCircularQueue.deQueue();  // return True\nmyCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return True\nmyCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 4\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= 1000\n0 <= value <= 1000\nAt most 3000 calls will be made to\u00a0enQueue, deQueue,\u00a0Front,\u00a0Rear,\u00a0isEmpty, and\u00a0isFull.\n\n",

The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\nYou are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string \"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\". For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\nA function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.\nReturn the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"1:start:2\",\"1:end:5\",\"0:end:6\"]\nOutput: [3,4]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"0:start:6\",\"0:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [8]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\nFunction 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:6\",\"1:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [7,1]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 100\n1 <= logs.length <= 500\n0 <= function_id < n\n0 <= timestamp <= 109\nNo two start events will happen at the same timestamp.\nNo two end events will happen at the same timestamp.\nEach function has an \"end\" log for each \"start\" log.\n\n",

        "description": "A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:\n\n'A' -> \"1\"\n'B' -> \"2\"\n...\n'Z' -> \"26\"\n\nTo decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, \"11106\" can be mapped into:\n\n\"AAJF\" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)\n\"KJF\" with the grouping (11 10 6)\n\nNote that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because \"06\" cannot be mapped into 'F' since \"6\" is different from \"06\".\nIn addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' ('0' is excluded). For example, the encoded message \"1*\" may represent any of the encoded messages \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \"16\", \"17\", \"18\", or \"19\".

This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\\n'.\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n\nThe string \"//\" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\nThe string \"/*\" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of \"*/\" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\nFor example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\nSimilarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\nFor example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.\nAfter removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: source = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \"  // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \"   multiline  \", \"   comment for \", \"   testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"]\nOutput: [\"int main()\",\"{ \",\"  \",\"int a, b, c;\",\"a = b + c;\",\"}\"]\nExplanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:\n/*Test program */\nint main()\n{ \n  // variable declaration \nint a, b, c;\n/* This is a test\n   multiline  \n   comment for \n   testing */\na = b + c;\n}\nThe string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.\nThe line by line output code is visualized as below:\nint main()\n{ \n  \nint a, b, c;\na = b + c;\n}\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: source = [\"a/*comment\", \"line\", \"more_comment*/b\"]\nOutput: [\"ab\"]\nExplanation: The original source string is \"a/*comment\\nline\\nmore_comment*/b\", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"].\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= source.length <= 100\n0 <= source[i].length <= 80\nsource[i] consists of printable ASCII characters.\nEvery open block comment is eventually closed.\nThere are no single-quote or\u00a0double-quote in the input.\n\n",

Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n(An integer could be positive or negative.)\nA let expression takes the form \"(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)\", where let is always the string \"let\", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.\nAn add expression takes the form \"(add e1 e2)\" where add is always the string \"add\", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\nA mult expression takes the form \"(mult e1 e2)\" where mult is always the string \"mult\", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\nFor this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names \"add\", \"let\", and \"mult\" are protected and will never be used as variable names.\nFinally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: expression = \"(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\"\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: expression = \"(let x 3 x 2 x)\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: expression = \"(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= expression.length <= 2000\nThere are no leading or trailing spaces in expression.\nAll tokens are separated by a single space in expression.\nThe answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\nThe expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.\n\n",

In one move, you can play an unplayed token in one of the two ways (but not both for the same token):\n\nFace-up: If your current power is at least tokens[i], you may play tokeni, losing tokens[i] power and gaining 1 score.\nFace-down: If your current score is at least 1, you may play tokeni, gaining tokens[i] power and losing 1 score.\n\nReturn the maximum possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: tokens = [100], power = 50\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Since your score is 0 initially, you cannot play the token face-down.

The maximum score achievable is 1.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: tokens = [100,200,300,400], power = 200\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Play the tokens in this order to get a score of 2:\n\nPlay token0 (100) face-up, reducing power to 100 and increasing score to 1.\nPlay token3 (400) face-down, increasing power to 500 and reducing score to 0.\nPlay token1 (200) face-up, reducing power to 300 and increasing score to 1.\nPlay token2 (300) face-up, reducing power to 0 and increasing score to 2.\n\nThe maximum score achievable is 2.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= tokens.length <= 1000\n0 <= tokens[i], power < 104\n\n",

Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.\nYou may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:\n\nDuring odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\nDuring even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\nIt may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.\n\nA starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).\nReturn the number of good starting indices.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.\nFrom starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.\nIn total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of\njumps.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:\nDuring our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].\nDuring our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3\nDuring our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].\nWe can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.\nIn a similar manner, we can deduce that:\nFrom starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.\nIn total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some\nnumber of jumps.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 104\n0 <= arr[i] < 105\n\n",

Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.\nFor example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:\n\nArtyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).\nSee more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list\nImplement the Skiplist class:\n\nSkiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.\nbool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.\nvoid add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.\nbool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.\n\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput\n[\"Skiplist\", \"add\", \"add\", \"add\", \"search\", \"add\", \"search\", \"erase\", \"erase\", \"search\"]\n[[], [1], [2], [3], [0], [4], [1], [0], [1], [1]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, null, false, null, true, false, true, false]\n\nExplanation\nSkiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();\nskiplist.add(1);\nskiplist.add(2);\nskiplist.add(3);\nskiplist.search(0); // return False\nskiplist.add(4);\nskiplist.search(1); // return True\nskiplist.erase(0);  // return False, 0 is not in skiplist.\nskiplist.erase(1);  // return True\nskiplist.search(1); // return False, 1 has already been erased.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= num, target <= 2 * 104\nAt most 5 * 104 calls will be made to search, add, and erase.\n\n",

        "description": "Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by\u00a0replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string\u00a0\"aabccc\"\u00a0we replace \"aa\"\u00a0by\u00a0\"a2\"\u00a0and replace \"ccc\"\u00a0by\u00a0\"c3\". Thus the compressed string becomes \"a2bc3\".\nNotice that in this problem, we are not adding\u00a0'1'\u00a0after single characters.\nGiven a\u00a0string s\u00a0and an integer k. You need to delete at most\u00a0k characters from\u00a0s\u00a0such that the run-length encoded version of s\u00a0has minimum length.\nFind the minimum length of the run-length encoded\u00a0version of s after deleting at most k characters.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"aaabcccd\", k = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us \"a3bc3d\" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = \"abcccd\" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be \"a3c3\" of length 4.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"aabbaa\", k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be \"a4\" of length 2.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"aaaaaaaaaaa\", k = 0\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything.

You have the ability to rotate the gondolas counterclockwise, which costs you runningCost dollars.\nYou are given an array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of new customers arriving just before the ith rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel i times before the customers[i] customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays boardingCost dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.\nYou can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.\nReturn the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit.

        "description": "You are given a phone number as a string number. number consists of digits, spaces ' ', and/or dashes '-'.\nYou would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then, group the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:\n\n2 digits: A single block of length 2.\n3 digits: A single block of length 3.\n4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.\n\nThe blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should never produce any blocks of length 1 and produce at most two blocks of length 2.\nReturn the phone number after formatting.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: number = \"1-23-45 6\"\nOutput: \"123-456\"\nExplanation: The digits are \"123456\".\nStep 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is \"123\".\nStep 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is \"456\".\nJoining the blocks gives \"123-456\".\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: number = \"123 4-567\"\nOutput: \"123-45-67\"\nExplanation: The digits are \"1234567\".\nStep 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is \"123\".\nStep 2: There are 4 digits left, so split them into two blocks of length 2. The blocks are \"45\" and \"67\".\nJoining the blocks gives \"123-45-67\".\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: number = \"123 4-5678\"\nOutput: \"123-456-78\"\nExplanation: The digits are \"12345678\".\nStep 1: The 1st block is \"123\".\nStep 2: The 2nd block is \"456\".\nStep 3: There are 2 digits left, so put them in a single block of length 2. The 3rd block is \"78\".\nJoining the blocks gives \"123-456-78\".\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= number.length <= 100\nnumber consists of digits and the characters '-' and ' '.\nThere are at least two digits in number.\n\n",

The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the length of the ith road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at.\nAfter you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road.

You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.\nUpgrade: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true:\n\t\nThe node is unlocked,\nIt has at least one locked descendant (by any user), and\nIt does not have any locked ancestors.\n\n\n\nImplement the LockingTree class:\n\nLockingTree(int[] parent) initializes the data structure with the parent array.\nlock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to lock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become locked by the user with id user.\nunlock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to unlock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become unlocked.\nupgrade(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to upgrade the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will be upgraded.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput\n[\"LockingTree\", \"lock\", \"unlock\", \"unlock\", \"lock\", \"upgrade\", \"lock\"]\n[[[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2], [4, 5], [0, 1], [0, 1]]\nOutput\n[null, true, false, true, true, true, false]\n\nExplanation\nLockingTree lockingTree = new LockingTree([-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]);\nlockingTree.lock(2, 2);    // return true because node 2 is unlocked.\n                           // Node 2 will now be locked by user 2.\nlockingTree.unlock(2, 3);  // return false because user 3 cannot unlock a node locked by user 2.\nlockingTree.unlock(2, 2);  // return true because node 2 was previously locked by user 2.\n                           // Node 2 will now be unlocked.\nlockingTree.lock(4, 5);    // return true because node 4 is unlocked.\n                           // Node 4 will now be locked by user 5.\nlockingTree.upgrade(0, 1); // return true because node 0 is unlocked and has at least one locked descendant (node 4).\n                           // Node 0 will now be locked by user 1 and node 4 will now be unlocked.\nlockingTree.lock(0, 1);    // return false because node 0 is already locked.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == parent.length\n2 <= n <= 2000\n0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1 for i != 0\nparent[0] == -1\n0 <= num <= n - 1\n1 <= user <= 104\nparent represents a valid tree.\nAt most 2000 calls in total will be made to lock, unlock, and upgrade.\n\n",

The sum of the points is 2+5+0=7.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"3+5*2\", answers = [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]\nOutput: 19\nExplanation: The correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore three students are rewarded 5 points each: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]\nA student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((3+5)*2 = 16. Therefore two students are rewarded 2 points: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]\nThe points for the students are: [5,0,0,5,5,2,2]. The sum of the points is 5+0+0+5+5+2+2=19.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"6+0*1\", answers = [12,9,6,4,8,6]\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: The correct answer of the expression is 6.\nIf a student had incorrectly done (6+0)*1, the answer would also be 6.\nBy the rules of grading, the students will still be rewarded 5 points (as they got the correct answer), not 2 points.\nThe points for the students are: [0,0,5,0,0,5]. The sum of the points is 10.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= s.length <= 31\ns represents a valid expression that contains only digits 0-9, '+', and '*' only.\nAll the integer operands in the expression are in the inclusive range [0, 9].\n1 <= The count of all operators ('+' and '*') in the math expression <= 15\nTest data are generated such that the correct answer of the expression is in the range of [0, 1000].\nn == answers.length\n1 <= n <= 104\n0 <= answers[i] <= 1000\n\n",

Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].\nSince the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:\n\nCount all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C.\n\n\t\nFor example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546.\n\n\nDenote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros.

She chose an arbitrary positive integer k and created two new 0-indexed integer arrays lower and higher in the following manner:\n\nlower[i] = arr[i] - k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n\nhigher[i] = arr[i] + k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n\n\nUnfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays lower and higher, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.\nGiven an array nums consisting of 2n integers, where exactly n of the integers were present in lower and the remaining in higher, return the original array arr. In case the answer is not unique, return any valid array.\nNote: The test cases are generated such that there exists at least one valid array arr.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12]\nOutput: [3,7,11]\nExplanation:\nIf arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12].\nCombining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums.\nAnother valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12]. \n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,3,3]\nOutput: [2,2]\nExplanation:\nIf arr = [2,2] and k = 1, we get lower = [1,1] and higher = [3,3].\nCombining lower and higher gives us [1,1,3,3], which is equal to nums.\nNote that arr cannot be [1,3] because in that case, the only possible way to obtain [1,1,3,3] is with k = 0.\nThis is invalid since k must be positive.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [5,435]\nOutput: [220]\nExplanation:\nThe only possible combination is arr = [220] and k = 215.

We now have five piles of candies of sizes 5, 5, 3, 5, and 1. We can allocate the 3 piles of size 5 to 3 children. It can be proven that each child cannot receive more than 5 candies.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: candies = [2,5], k = 11\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are 11 children but only 7 candies in total, so it is impossible to ensure each child receives at least one candy. Thus, each child gets no candy and the answer is 0.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= candies.length <= 105\n1 <= candies[i] <= 107\n1 <= k <= 1012\n\n",

The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving.\nAt any moment, you can set the initial direction of moving for some robot.

You are also given an array of even integers amount, where amount[i] represents:\n\nthe price needed to open the gate at node i, if amount[i] is negative, or,\nthe cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node i, otherwise.\n\nThe game goes on as follows:\n\nInitially, Alice is at node 0 and Bob is at node bob.\nAt every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node.

Initially, all k workers are waiting on the left side of the bridge.

Hence, the answer is 0.\nIn the second query, all the edges in the path from 3 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 0.\nIn the third query, we change the weight of edge [2,3] to 2. After this operation, all the edges in the path from 2 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 1.\nIn the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,1], [1,2] and [2,3] to 2. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 3.\nFor each queries[i], it can be shown that answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to equalize all the edge weights in the path from ai to bi.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: n = 8, edges = [[1,2,6],[1,3,4],[2,4,6],[2,5,3],[3,6,6],[3,0,8],[7,0,2]], queries = [[4,6],[0,4],[6,5],[7,4]]\nOutput: [1,2,2,3]\nExplanation: In the first query, we change the weight of edge [1,3] to 6. After this operation, all the edges in the path from 4 to 6 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 1.\nIn the second query, we change the weight of edges [0,3] and [3,1] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.\nIn the third query, we change the weight of edges [1,3] and [5,2] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 6 to 5 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.\nIn the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,7], [0,3] and [1,3] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 7 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 3.\nFor each queries[i], it can be shown that answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to equalize all the edge weights in the path from ai to bi.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 104\nedges.length == n - 1\nedges[i].length == 3\n0 <= ui, vi < n\n1 <= wi <= 26\nThe input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.\n1 <= queries.length == m <= 2 * 104\nqueries[i].length == 2\n0 <= ai, bi < n\n\n",

Initially, you have stock[i] units of metal type i, and purchasing one unit of metal type i costs cost[i] coins.\nGiven integers n, k, budget, a 1-indexed 2D array composition, and 1-indexed arrays stock and cost, your goal is to maximize the number of alloys the company can create while staying within the budget of budget coins.\nAll alloys must be created with the same machine.\nReturn the maximum number of alloys that the company can create.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3, k = 2, budget = 15, composition = [[1,1,1],[1,1,10]], stock = [0,0,0], cost = [1,2,3]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: It is optimal to use the 1st machine to create alloys.\nTo create 2 alloys we need to buy the:\n- 2 units of metal of the 1st type.\n- 2 units of metal of the 2nd type.\n- 2 units of metal of the 3rd type.\nIn total, we need 2 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 3 = 12 coins, which is smaller than or equal to budget = 15.\nNotice that we have 0 units of metal of each type and we have to buy all the required units of metal.\nIt can be proven that we can create at most 2 alloys.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 3, k = 2, budget = 15, composition = [[1,1,1],[1,1,10]], stock = [0,0,100], cost = [1,2,3]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: It is optimal to use the 2nd machine to create alloys.\nTo create 5 alloys we need to buy:\n- 5 units of metal of the 1st type.\n- 5 units of metal of the 2nd type.\n- 0 units of metal of the 3rd type.\nIn total, we need 5 * 1 + 5 * 2 + 0 * 3 = 15 coins, which is smaller than or equal to budget = 15.\nIt can be proven that we can create at most 5 alloys.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 2, k = 3, budget = 10, composition = [[2,1],[1,2],[1,1]], stock = [1,1], cost = [5,5]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: It is optimal to use the 3rd machine to create alloys.\nTo create 2 alloys we need to buy the:\n- 1 unit of metal of the 1st type.\n- 1 unit of metal of the 2nd type.\nIn total, we need 1 * 5 + 1 * 5 = 10 coins, which is smaller than or equal to budget = 10.\nIt can be proven that we can create at most 2 alloys.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n, k <= 100\n0 <= budget <= 108\ncomposition.length == k\ncomposition[i].length == n\n1 <= composition[i][j] <= 100\nstock.length == cost.length == n\n0 <= stock[i] <= 108\n1 <= cost[i] <= 100\n\n",

To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:\u200b\n\nChoose a positive divisor d of the string's length. d can range from 1 up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length 1, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed.\nFor a given divisor d, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length d. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions 2, 2 + d, 2 + 2d, etc.\nThe string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome.\n\nConsider the string \"abcabc\":\n\nThe length of \"abcabc\" is 6. Valid divisors are 1, 2, and 3.\nFor d = 1: The entire string \"abcabc\" forms one group. Not a palindrome.\nFor d = 2:\n\t\nGroup 1 (positions 1, 3, 5): \"acb\"\nGroup 2 (positions 2, 4, 6): \"bac\"\nNeither group forms a palindrome.\n\n\nFor d = 3:\n\t\nGroup 1 (positions 1, 4): \"aa\"\nGroup 2 (positions 2, 5): \"bb\"\nGroup 3 (positions 3, 6): \"cc\"\nAll groups form palindromes.

You are also given two 0-indexed string arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of converting the string original[i] to the string changed[i].\nYou start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a substring x from the string, and change it to y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y. You are allowed to do any number of operations, but any pair of operations must satisfy either of these two conditions:\n\nThe substrings picked in the operations are source[a..b] and source[c..d] with either b < c or d < a. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are disjoint.\nThe substrings picked in the operations are source[a..b] and source[c..d] with a == c and b == d. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are identical.\n\nReturn the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations.

For example, the cost of [1,2,3] is 1 while the cost of [3,4,1] is 3.\nYou need to divide nums into k disjoint contiguous subarrays, such that the difference between the starting index of the second subarray and the starting index of the kth subarray should be less than or equal to dist. In other words, if you divide nums into the subarrays nums[0..(i1 - 1)], nums[i1..(i2 - 1)], ..., nums[ik-1..(n - 1)], then ik-1 - i1 <= dist.\nReturn the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,2,6,4,2], k = 3, dist = 3\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The best possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays is: [1,3], [2,6,4], and [2].

You are also given a non-negative integer threshold.\nTwo pixels are adjacent if they share an edge.\nA region is a 3 x 3 subgrid where the absolute difference in intensity between any two adjacent pixels is less than or equal to threshold.\nAll pixels in a region belong to that region, note that a pixel can belong to multiple regions.\nYou need to calculate a m x n grid result, where result[i][j] is the average intensity of the regions to which image[i][j] belongs, rounded down to the nearest integer. If image[i][j] belongs to multiple regions, result[i][j] is the average of the rounded-down average intensities of these regions, rounded down to the nearest integer. If image[i][j] does not belong to any region, result[i][j] is equal to image[i][j].\nReturn the grid result.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: image = [[5,6,7,10],[8,9,10,10],[11,12,13,10]], threshold = 3\nOutput: [[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9]]\nExplanation:\n\nThere are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 9, while the average intensity of the second region is 9.67 which is rounded down to 9. The average intensity of both of the regions is (9 + 9) / 2 = 9. As all the pixels belong to either region 1, region 2, or both of them, the intensity of every pixel in the result is 9.\nPlease note that the rounded-down values are used when calculating the average of multiple regions, hence the calculation is done using 9 as the average intensity of region 2, not 9.67.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: image = [[10,20,30],[15,25,35],[20,30,40],[25,35,45]], threshold = 12\nOutput: [[25,25,25],[27,27,27],[27,27,27],[30,30,30]]\nExplanation:\n\nThere are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 25, while the average intensity of the second region is 30. The average intensity of both of the regions is (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5 which is rounded down to 27.\nAll the pixels in row 0 of the image belong to region 1, hence all the pixels in row 0 in the result are 25. Similarly, all the pixels in row 3 in the result are 30. The pixels in rows 1 and 2 of the image belong to region 1 and region 2, hence their assigned value is 27 in the result.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: image = [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]], threshold = 1\nOutput: [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]]\nExplanation:\nThere is only one 3 x 3 subgrid, while it does not have the condition on difference of adjacent pixels, for example, the difference between image[0][0] and image[1][0] is |5 - 8| = 3 > threshold = 1. None of them belong to any valid regions, so the result should be the same as image.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= n, m <= 500\n0 <= image[i][j] <= 255\n0 <= threshold <= 255\n\n",
